What is CSS?
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
External stylesheets are stored in CSS files
A CSS rule consists of a selector and a declaration block.

        <p>The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.

            The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.
    
            Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.
    
            Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.
